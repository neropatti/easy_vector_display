# Easy Vector Display
This add-on adds a node called `VectorDisplay2D`. Just point it to a node, and enter in the property you want displayed.

Currently only supports `Vector2`.

Hit `V` to toggle the vector display.

## TODO:
 - Ignore parent object rotation
 - 3D vectors?

This is just a to-do list if I have nothing else to do.
