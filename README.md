# !!NOTICE!!

The current 3D version does NOT display the combined vector correctly. I am ~~working~~ procastinating on it. Whoops.

# Easy Vector Display
This add-on adds nodes `VectorDisplay2D` & `VectorDisplay3D`. Just point them to a node, and enter in the property you want displayed.

Currently only supports `Vector2` and `Vector3`.

Hit `V` to toggle the vector display.
